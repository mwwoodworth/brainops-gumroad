### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue: "I can't download the product"**
→ Direct to Gumroad Library: https://app.gumroad.com/library

**Issue: "The ZIP file won't extract"**
→ Suggest 7-Zip (Windows) or The Unarchiver (Mac)

**Issue: "I'm getting errors in the code"**
→ Ask for: Screenshot, environment details, what they were doing

**Issue: "This isn't what I expected"**
→ Refund immediately, ask for feedback

**Issue: "Can I use this for client work?"**
→ Yes! Unlimited client use, just can't resell as a product

### Automated Responses (Future)

When you receive 10+ support emails, consider:
1. Creating a Zendesk account
2. Setting up auto-responses for common issues
3. Creating a knowledge base
4. Hiring a VA for $10/hour to triage

For now, manual = personal = better customer experience.
