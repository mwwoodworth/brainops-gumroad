## Save 200+ Hours on Your Next SaaS
Stop rewriting the same authentication, database setup, and API logic. The **SaaS ERP Starter Kit** is the exact architecture used to build enterprise-grade platforms like WeatherCraft.

### What You Get
- **Production Architecture**: A proven folder structure for scaling Next.js apps.
- **Multi-Tenant Database Schema**: Ready-to-deploy SQL for Supabase (Customers, Invoices, Jobs).
- **Service Layer Pattern**: The "Secret Sauce" for keeping your API routes clean and testable.
- **Role-Based Security**: Row Level Security (RLS) policies pre-configured.

### Why This Matters
Most boilerplate is just a "Hello World" app. This is extracted from a *real*, complex ERP system handling millions in transaction volume. It handles the hard stuff: race conditions, real-time updates, and complex data relationships.

### Contents
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`: The master plan.
- `schema.sql`: The database foundation.
- `service-pattern.ts`: The code structure guide.
- `auth-setup.md`: The security guide.
