## Build Your Own AI Operating System
Don't just build a chatbot. Build an **Orchestrator**. This Python framework is the engine behind BrainOps, capable of managing dozens of specialized AI agents that work together to solve complex problems.

### The "BrainOps" Pattern
Most AI apps are single-threaded. This framework allows you to:
1.  **Route Tasks**: An intelligent router sends work to the best agent (e.g., "Coder" vs "Researcher").
2.  **Share Memory**: All agents read/write to a central vector database.
3.  **Execute Tools**: Agents can run Python code, query databases, and call APIs.

### What You Get
- **FastAPI Boilerplate**: Async, high-performance backend structure.
- **Agent Base Class**: The Python class that defines an autonomous agent.
- **Orchestrator Logic**: The routing algorithm.
- **Memory Architecture**: How to structure your Postgres/pgvector for infinite context.

### Perfect For
- Developers building internal AI tools.
- Agencies building AI automation for clients.
- Founders prototyping "Agentic" SaaS.
