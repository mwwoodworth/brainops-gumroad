# PM Accelerator Playbook

## Philosophy
Stop managing admin; start managing value. This playbook moves you from "Status Updater" to "Strategic Leader."

## Core Workflows
1. **The 5-Minute Meeting Prep**: Paste previous meeting notes into the `project-intelligence` prompt to generate an agenda and open questions.
2. **The Weekly Status**: Use `templates/weekly-status.md` filled out by the `stakeholder-alignment` prompt to keep execs happy without spending hours formatting.
3. **Resource Tetris**: Use `resource-optimization` to spot bottlenecks before they happen.

## Troubleshooting
- **AI Hallucinations**: Always verify dates and budget numbers.
- **Context Window**: If notes are too long, summarize them in chunks first.
