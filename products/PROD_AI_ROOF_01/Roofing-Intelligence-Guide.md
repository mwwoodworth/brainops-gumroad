### The Modern Estimator's Secret Weapon

---

## 🚀 Quick Start
**Goal:** Stop leaving money on the table. Catch hidden costs, validate calculations, and protect your margins using AI.

### 📋 The 3-Step Workflow

#### **Step 1: The Pre-Bid Audit**
*   **What:** Turn messy field notes into a structured scope of work.
*   **Action:** Copy the text from `prompts/pre-bid-analysis.txt`. Paste it into ChatGPT/Claude along with your raw notes.
*   **Result:** A clear list of deliverables and, crucially, a list of **Missing Information** you need to ask the client immediately.

#### **Step 2: Cost & Material Validation**
*   **What:** Sanity check your material takeoff and labor hours.
*   **Action:** Use `prompts/cost-calculation.txt`. Input your dimensions and material type.
*   **Result:** A baseline estimate range. *Note: Always verify specific SKU pricing with your local supplier.*

#### **Step 3: Profit Protection (Risk Assessment)**
*   **What:** Identify the "Silent Killers" of profit (access issues, safety hazards, weather delays).
*   **Action:** Run `prompts/risk-assessment.txt`.
*   **Result:** A risk matrix that helps you decide if you need to add a contingency buffer (e.g., +5% for difficult access).

## 💡 Pro Tips for Success

> **"The AI is your junior estimator, not your boss."**

*   **Sanitize Data:** Never paste client names, phone numbers, or exact addresses into public AI tools. Use "Client X" or "Project Alpha".
*   **Context is King:** The more detail you give the prompt about the *site conditions* (e.g., "urban area, tight clearance, 4th floor"), the better the output.
*   **Iterate:** If the AI output is too generic, tell it: *"Be more specific about TPO membrane installation on a 2/12 pitch."*
