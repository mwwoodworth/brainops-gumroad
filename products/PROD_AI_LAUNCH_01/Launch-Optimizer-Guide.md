# Launch Optimizer Guide

## Phase 1: Pre-Launch (Positioning)
Don't skip this. Use the `positioning.txt` prompt. You need to know *exactly* who you are selling to and what specific pain point you solve.

## Phase 2: Assets (Copy)
Use the templates. They follow standard copywriting formulas (AIDA/PAS) that are proven to convert.

## Phase 3: Execution (The Sequence)
The money is in the follow-up. Our `launch-sequence.txt` prompt helps you map out the 7-14 days surrounding your cart open date.

## Troubleshooting
- **Low Open Rates**: Focus on subject lines (ask the AI for 10 variations).
- **Low Conversion**: Use `sales-optimization.txt` to audit your page copy.
