# BrainOps Revenue Engine - 5-Part Launch Email Sequence

## EMAIL 1: THE ANNOUNCEMENT (Day 0 - Launch Day)

**Subject Line:** We just launched 10 products in 24 hours (here's why)

**Body:**

Hey [First Name],

Quick question: What could you build in 200 hours?

Because that's the time you're about to get back.

After 18 months building enterprise SaaS platforms (WeatherCraft ERP, MyRoofGenius), I extracted every reusable prompt, automation blueprint, and code pattern into a product library.

**Launching today:**
- 7 AI Prompt & Automation Packs ($97-$497)
- 3 Production Code Starter Kits ($97-$197)

The theme? **Time Compression.**

Every product is built to collapse weeks of work into hours—or hours into minutes.

**Special Launch Offer:**
Use code **LAUNCH20** for 20% off everything (expires in 48 hours).

## EMAIL 2: THE CODE PRODUCTS DEEP DIVE (Day 1)

**Subject Line:** "Just give me the code" - these 3 starter kits are for you

**Body:**

Hey [First Name],

If you're a developer or technical founder, this email is pure gold.

Yesterday I launched 10 products. Today I'm zooming in on the **3 Code Starter Kits**—because they solve the most expensive problem in SaaS: reinventing the wheel.

### **1. SaaS ERP Starter Kit ($197)**
**The Problem:** You're starting a new SaaS. You spend 3 months arguing about folder structure, authentication patterns, and database design before writing any business logic.

**The Solution:** Production-tested architecture handling $303M in transactions across 4,300+ tenants.

**What's Inside:**
- Multi-tenant Supabase schema (SQL)
- Service Layer pattern (the "secret sauce" for clean APIs)
- Row Level Security policies (pre-configured)
- Next.js folder structure that scales

**Time Saved:** 200-300 hours of architectural trial-and-error.

👉 [Get the SaaS ERP Starter Kit]

---

### **2. BrainOps AI Orchestrator Framework ($147)**
**The Problem:** You want to build AI agents, not a single chatbot. But orchestrating multiple agents with shared memory and tool execution? That's a research project.

**The Solution:** The exact Python framework managing 14 autonomous AI systems in production.

**What's Inside:**
- FastAPI boilerplate (async, high-performance)
- Agent Base Class (plug-and-play)
- Router logic (task → best agent)
- Vector memory architecture (Postgres/pgvector)

**Time Saved:** 150-200 hours of distributed systems architecture.

👉 [Get the AI Orchestrator Framework]

---

### **3. Modern Command Center UI Kit ($97)**
**The Problem:** You can build the backend, but your UI looks like a 2015 admin panel. Hiring a designer costs $10K+.

**The Solution:** Copy-paste glassmorphic components that look like sci-fi.

**What's Inside:**
- Dashboard shell (sidebar + header)
- Metric cards (beautiful KPI containers)
- Live task stream (real-time activity)
- Income Lab interface (complex data tables done right)

**Tech Stack:** React, Tailwind, Lucide Icons, Framer Motion.

**Time Saved:** 30-40 hours of CSS hell.

👉 [Get the Modern UI Kit]

---

### **🔥 BUNDLE DEAL:**
Grab all 3 for **$397** (normally $441) - save $44.

👉 [Get the Code Bundle]

**Reminder:** Use code **LAUNCH20** for an additional 20% off (expires in 36 hours).

These aren't boilerplates with "Hello World" apps. They're battle-tested production code extracted from real systems.

—Matt

P.S. - Every kit includes support. If something doesn't work, I'll help you fix it.

## EMAIL 3: THE AUTOMATION PACKS (Day 2)

**Subject Line:** I automated my entire client pipeline with Make.com (steal my blueprints)
