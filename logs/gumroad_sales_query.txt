GUMROAD SALES TRACKING - MANUAL PROCESS
========================================

Since Gumroad doesn't have a public API, track sales manually:

1. Go to: https://gumroad.com/analytics
2. Note the following metrics daily:
   - Total Sales (count)
   - Total Revenue (USD)
   - Top Selling Product
   - Average Order Value
   - Traffic Sources (email, social, direct, etc.)

3. Update the tracking file: gumroad_daily_sales.csv

Format:
Date,Total_Sales,Revenue_USD,Top_Product,Avg_Order_Value,Email_Sales,Social_Sales,Direct_Sales,Other_Sales

Example:
2025-11-22,15,3750.00,GR-ULTIMATE,250.00,8,4,2,1

4. Run analytics script to import into database:
   ./import-gumroad-sales.sh
